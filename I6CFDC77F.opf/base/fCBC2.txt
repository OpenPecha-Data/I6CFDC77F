(3C) 'For example, Bhadrapāla, women or men in dreams while sleeping neither know if they are at home nor know if they ar
e elsewhere, and their faculty of sightis not obstructed by walls, nor is it darkened or obscured. In the same way, Bhad
rapāla, those bodhisattvas and mahāsattvas too conceive a thought in such a way that the spaces between worlds do not ob
struct them, that Sumeru, King of Mountains, the Cakravāḍa;la and the Greater Cakravāḍa, Kings of Mountains, and similar
ly the Black Mountains do not obstruct their faculty of sight; those bodhisattvas do not see the Tathāgata through obtai
ning divine vision, do not hear the True Dharma through obtaining the divine faculty of hearing, and do not travel insta
ntaneously to that world-system through obtaining magic power, but while remammg in this very world-system, Bhadrapāla, 
those bodhisattvas see that Lord and Tathāgata Amitāyus, perceive themselves as being in that world-system, and also hea
r the Dharma.And they retain, master, and preserve those dharmas after hearing them expounded. They honour, revere, vene
rate and worship that Lord, the Tathāgata, Arhat and Perfectly Awakened One Amitāyus.And on emerging from that samādhi t
he bodhisattvas expound at length to others those dharmas, just as they have heard, retained, and mastered them.'
