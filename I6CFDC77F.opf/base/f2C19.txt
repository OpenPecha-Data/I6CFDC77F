(3J) 'For example, Bhadrapāla, when a bhikṣu performing the meditation on the repulsive sees in front of him bloated corp
ses, when he sees in front of him corpses that have turned blue, that are putrefied, that are bloody, that are gnawed, t
hat the flesh has peeled from, or that have no flesh or blood, or are white, or the colour of shells, or those that are 
skeletons, then those things-from the blue corpse to tJ1e skeleton--have not come from anywhere, nor have they gone anyw
here. They are not made by anyone, nor are they made to cease by anyone, yet, Bhadrapāla, by that bhikṣu's mastery of me
ntal focussing he sees the skeleton lying in front of him.''In the same manner, Bhadrapāla, whatever quarter Tathāgatas,
Arhats and Perfectly Awakened Ones might dwell in, those bodhisattvas who are supported by the Buddha and established i
n this samādhi concentrate their minds on that quarter, in order to obtain a vision of the Buddhas. By concentrating the
ir minds on that quarter they see the Tathāgatas, Arhats and Perfectly Awakened Ones in that quarter. Why is that? Namel
y, Bhadrapāla, this obtaining .Qf a vision of the Buddhas is the natural outcome of this samādhi. Bodhisattvas who are e
stablished in this samādhi see the Tathāgatas, and they appear to them, through the combination and concurrence of these
three things: the might (Skt. anubhava) of the Buddha, the application of the force of their own wholesome potentialiti
es, and the power [which is the result] of attaining samādhi.'
