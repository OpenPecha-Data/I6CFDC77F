(3I) 'For example, Bhadrapāla, a certain man travelled from his native land to another country, and arriving there he cal
led to mind his native land; while concentrating his thoughts on things as he used to see, hear, know, and perceive them
he was overcome by torpor and lethargy, and fell asleep; in a dream he travelled to his native land and perceived himse
lf to be there, and he saw those things just as he formerly used to see, hear, discern and be aware of them; he went bot
h to and from that place. Waking up, he reported those things in the company of his relatives, friends, kinsfolk, and ma
ternal relations, saying:"Thus did I go, these things I saw, these things I experienced in that place.'"'In the same man
ner, Bhadrapāla, bodhisattvas, whether they are householders or renunciants, should, when they hear that a Tathāgata res
ides in such and such a quarter, concentrate on the Tathāgata in that quarter with mindfulness and undistracted thoughts
, in order to obtain a vision of the Buddha. In that way those bodhisattvas will see the Tathāgata [like] a beautifully 
set up beryl image.
