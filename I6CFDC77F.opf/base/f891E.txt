(3B) 'For example, Bhadrapāla, some men or women in dreams while sleeping see various material forms, see silver, gold, f
riends, kinfolk, maternal relations, or companions that are pleasing, dear, and not disagreeable to them, and in those d
reams they dream of playing, dallying, and amusing themselves with them, of speaking and conversing with them. When they
wake up they relate to others all those things and people that they saw, heard, thought, were conscious of, spoke and c
onversed with; and they shed tears at recalling the things which appeared (Skt. nimitta) in their dreams. In the same wa
y, Bhadrapāla, bodhisattvas, whether they be householders or renunciants, go alone to a secluded spot and sit down, and 
in accordance with what they have learned they concentrate their thoughts on the Tathāgata, Arhat and Perfectly Awakened
One Amitāyus; flawless in the constituent of morality and unwavering in mindfulness they should concentrate their thoug
hts on him for one day and one night, or for two, or three, or four, or five, or six, or seven days and nights.If they c
oncentrate their thoughts with undistracted minds on the Tathāgata Amitāyus for seven days and nights, then, when a full
seven days and nights have elapsed, they see the Lord and Tathāgata Amitāyus.Should they not see that Lord during the d
aytime, then the Lord and Tathāgata Amitāyus will show his face to them in a dream while they are sleeping.'
