(3M) '"That thought is not apprehended as being inside, nor as being outside, nor as neither of the two, on the contrary,
it is produced on the basis of objectification.That which is [in this way] produced conditionally (Skt. pratītya-samutp
anna) has no substantial existence (Skt. abhāva). That which has no substantial existence is unborn. That which is unbor
n is not apprehensible as an object (Skt. anupalambha). That which is not apprehensible as an object is empty of essence
(Skt. svabhāva-śūnya). That which is empty of essence is indefinable. That which is indefinable is unable to be seen, d
iscerned, fixated upon, demonstrated, destroyed, or established."'
