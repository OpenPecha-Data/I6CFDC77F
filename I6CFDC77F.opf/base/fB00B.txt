(3G) 'After they developed that samādhi and concentrated themselves in that samādhi, those bodhisattvas, when they emerge
d from that samādhi, came to you, Bhadrapāla, and told you about that samādhi. Then, Bhadrapāla, you taught the Dharma s
o that those bodhisattvas became unable to regress from supreme and perfect awakening. Then I also predicted that at a f
uture time those men would become Tathāgatas, Arhats and Perfectly Awakened Ones under the name of *Prāptapratibhāna.''B
hadrapāla, you yourself, the Elder Mahākāśyapa, the bodhisattva Indradatta, the bodhisattva Susīma and, moreover, the bo
dhisattvas who have obtained this samādhi, have gained mastery from this samādhi.'
